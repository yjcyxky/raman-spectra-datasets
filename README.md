## Raman Spectra Datasets

A collection of Raman spectra datasets for machine learning and data analysis.


### RRUFF

The RRUFF™ Project is creating a complete set of high quality spectral data from well characterized minerals and is developing the technology to share this information with the world. The collected data provides a standard for mineralogists, geoscientists, gemologists and the general public for the identification of minerals both on earth and for planetary exploration.
